Experiment Plan:
	The experiment plan for my project largely consists of gathering timing
information. I plan to time:
	- data segmentation/distribution time: how long it takes to divide the
	dataset into blocks and distribute those blocks to the cache nodes.
	- network communication time during rendering: how much time is spent
	waiting for blocks to be transmitted from cache nodes to render nodes.
	- rendering time per node: how long an individual render node takes
	to render its portion of the image.
	- total rendering time: how long it takes to render the entire image.
	- output image composition time: how long it takes to composite the
	outputs from the render nodes.
I also plan to track the number of blocks requested from each cache node.
By doing this I hope to get a feel for the efficiency/usefullness of my
caching strategy.
	In order to get an accurate picture of my program's performance, I plan
to vary the following parameters:
	- number of cache nodes/render nodes: from 1->many nodes. I aim to find
	an optimal division of I/O and processing tasks.
	- transfer function: this function determines which features of the dataset
	are being rendered. It can play a big part in how long an image takes to
	render and also how much of the dataset needs to be traversed in order to
	render the output.
	- view transformation: zoomed in/out, rotated 360 degrees. This is the
	angle and scale of the dataset with respect to the view plane.
	- dataset size: datasets range in size from small (~4MB) to huge (many GBs)
	- in-memory cache size: from ~2MB to as much real memory as the nodes
	have. The more memory a node can use, the less it will need to use the
	network or disk.
