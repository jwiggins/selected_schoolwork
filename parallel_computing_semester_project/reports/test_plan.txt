CS377 Project Test Plan
4/9/2003

The test plan for my project is very simple. I will render images from a number
of datasets and compare the outputs with those of other renderers. The input
datasets will be rawiv files
(described here: http://www.ices.utexas.edu/~shrew/formats/rawiv.html) that I
will get from the CCV (http://www.ices.utexas.edu/~shrew/datasets/index.html).
I might also use artificial datasets generated by internal CCV software. The
outputs will be RGB images written in the ppm file format
(http://www.wotsit.org/download.asp?f=ppm). These images will be compared to
output from the CCV's Volume Rover software and possible output from the CCV's
pre-existing volume raycasting renderer. When comparing outputs, the criteria
for correctness will be similarity of the overall form of the rendered volume.
Differences in shading and color will be ignored.
