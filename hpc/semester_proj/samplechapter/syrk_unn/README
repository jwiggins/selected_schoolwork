following routines:

fill_matrix:  a routine for filling a matrix
              with random numbers

Trmm_left_lower_notrans_lev2.c:
              The unblocked lower triangular multiplication 
              routine from Chapter 4.

Trmm_left_lower_notrans.c:
              The blocked lower triangular multiplication 
              routine from Chapter 4.

test_all.c:   A driver for testing the accuracy and performance
              of all level-3 BLAS

test_ltrmm.c: A driver for testing the accuracy and performance
              of Trmm_left_lower_notrans and 
              Trmm_left_lower_notrans_lev2

Notice that test_ltrmm was derived from test_all.c by 
              editing that file.

To run test_all (a test of all level-3 BLAS)

make test_all
./test_all.x
operation (0 = symm, 1 = syrk, 2 = syr2k, 3 = trmm, 4 = trsm, -1 = quit):3
iop = 3
side (0 = Left, 1 = Right ):0
uplo (0 = Lower, 1 = Upper ):0
transa, (0 = No transpose, 1 = Transpose):0
unit diag ( 0 = No, 1 = Yes):0

To run test_ltrmm (a test of my lower triangular matrix 
multiplication algorithms):

make test_ltrmm
./test_ltrmm
